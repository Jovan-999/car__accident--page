                Fault is not always easy to determine in a car accident. Even when it seems clear, you still need the proper evidence to prove it. Our team will collect physical evidence, hire investigators and retain expert witnesses, take photos of the scene, obtain a copy of the accident report from the police, and speak to witnesses. </p>
                <p>Determining fault can make a big difference in the amount of compensation that you receive in a settlement offer. What’s more, this step is necessary, because you may not receive any compensation at all if negligence can’t be proven.</p>

                Reporting an injury claim to the insurance company (even your own) can be a complex process. You may not know how to file a claim, or whom to file against, or to what benefits you are entitled. </p>
                <p>Sometimes claims may need to be filed with more than one party. For example, if a defective part was involved in the accident, there may be manufacturing companies involved. As your Massachusetts car accident lawyers, we can determine what parties are involved and file all necessary legal claims on your behalf.</p>

                It might be tempting to take the first settlement amount offered to you after your accident, but it’s worth it to be careful. 
              </p>
                <p>Insurance companies know that after an accident you’re overwhelmed with stress and financial loss, and they often take advantage of this situation by offering a low payout. They know that you may be relieved to receive any sort of compensation at all. Once you accept a payout, there’s no turning back. You could miss out on thousands of dollars.
                </p>
              <p>Our Massachusetts car accident attorneys at Jason Stone Injury Lawyers have been reviewing settlement offers from insurance companies for over 20 years and are able to advise you whether an offer is a good one. If it isn’t, or if it doesn’t include everything that should be included, then we will continue to aggressively negotiate with the insurance company until we get you more money. It’s important to us that you receive an amount that compensates you for all of the difficulties that you have had since the crash which wasn’t your fault.</p>

               No one wants to sue, but sometimes you have to.
               Usually, injuries caused by car accidents
               can be settled out of court. However,
               we have learned that the best way to ensure
               a settlement we can be proud of is to prepare
               for trial from the very beginning.
               When the insurance company extends
               a low settlement offer, it is a good 
               practice to be ready to file a lawsuit
               and hold their feet to the fire if
               they don’t meet our demands.
